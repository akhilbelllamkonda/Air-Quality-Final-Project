\*\*I obtained the data from Kaggle, focusing on air quality measurements across Indian cities from 2015 to 2020. To ensure accuracy, I cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values, correcting formats, and removing duplicates. This process helped maintain data integrity by excluding incomplete or erroneous entries, enabling a reliable analysis of trends in air pollution metrics across urban areas in India.\*\*
